# Service Plans Overview
Our plans provide clients with a variety of service options, tailored to preconfigured tiers. Each plan is designed to offer a specific set of features and limitations based on the user type, ensuring a customized experience for each partner.

# Important Update Notice
Shortly after the implementation of this feature, your customer service processes and solutions may undergo adjustments due to a significant system update. Specifically, user records have been supplemented with additional properties, as described in the latest version of our API reference. For instance, users can now be placed in an ‘idle’ state if they do not confirm the purchase of a plan within a specified timeframe.

# Plan Customization
The number of plans per provider is unlimited, allowing you to create as many plans as needed and customize them to meet your specific requirements. Each plan reflects well-known user attributes and complies with the corresponding state regulations.
